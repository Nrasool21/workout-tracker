# workout-tracker

## Description

In this assignment I was asked to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express and built a workout tracker.

This application allows a user to view, create and track daily workouts as well as log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.

A user can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.

## What we did

## Getting started

`npm i`
`npm run seed`
